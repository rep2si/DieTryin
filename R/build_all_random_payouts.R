#' Select random payouts and generate corresponding
#'
#' Randomly select a number of allocations made by and to each player,
#' and generate the json files required for the payout activity in
#' DieTryinSR.
#'
#' This function requires the results of the allocations to have been
#' compiled with compile_subset_survey_data().
#'
#' @param n_alloc_keep Number of 'outgoing' allocations to select:
#' will implement the amount 'kept' by the player. If there are fewer
#' allocations than this number, implement the closest possible figure.
#' @param n_alloc_receive Number of 'incoming' allocations to select:
#' will implement the amount 'give' to the player. If there are fewer
#' allocations than this number, implement the closest possible figure.
#' @param guess_margin the margin within which an expected allocation
#' will be rewarded. E.g. set to 10 to reward all guesses within Â±10
#' of actual allocation.
#' @param guess_payout_amt The amount given per correct guess.
