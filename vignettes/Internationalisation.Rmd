The rep2si version of DieTryinSR, the android companion app used for data collection, supports full internationalisation. Every piece of text displayed in the app can be customised and shown in your preferred language.

When preparing the files for the DieTryinSR app, you will initially run `setup_folders()`. Options for this function are described in the package's README file and in the function documentation. This function will create a directory called `RICH`, which contains various files and subdirectories that you will eventually need to transfer to the android device on which you are running DieTryinSR.

Among the files generated by `setup_folders()` is `RICH/i18n.json`. Editing this file before transferring it to the android device will allow you to customise every string displayed in the app. The file uses UTF-8 character encoding, which should allow for wide coverage of different writing systems.

The file is initially populated with strings in English. At the time of writing, it contains the following fields:

```

To translate the app, **only edit the json values**. Leave the keys unchanged. So, for example, if you were translating the app into french, the first lines would look like this:

```{json}
{
  "alloc_amountHint": "quantit√©",
  "alloc_condAnon": "Anonyme",
  "alloc_condAnon_singleletter": "A",
  ...
``` 

## Keys and corresponding text in app

For the most part, the keys should be self-explanatory, and you should be easily locate the corresponding text in the app. Note the following:

- `alloc_condAnon_singleletter` and `alloc_condRevealed_singleletter` are single-letter abbreviations for the anonymous and revealed condition. In the app, they are displayed very discretely underneath the photograph of the alter.

- Strings starting with `demoRevelation` and `demoReputation` control the display of likert levels in corresponding demo screens, in the app. You almost certainly want to set these so that they correspond to the likert levels displayed in the Revelations and Reputations acitivity (these are controlled by the corresponding `build_subset_...` functions.
